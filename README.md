# Student Utilites

Student Utitlites program made for AP CSP Extended. Written using React.JS as a frontend and django as a backened

# Running the program

Install all the the requirements from the `requirements.txt`. This can be done using

```python
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed all the requirements, you can run the local server using

```python
py manage.py runserver
```

In some situations, you might have to use `manage` in the place of `manage.py`.

If this does not work for you, please ensure your system path's are set up correctly. You can try replacing `py`
with the path to your python executable. If you are running a UNIX based system, you might have to use `python3.9`
instead of `py`.
